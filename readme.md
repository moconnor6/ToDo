# ToDo

## Getting Started

i tried to use webpack instead of "create-react-app" to try and understand what all the modules for compiling and building a react app are for and the cra tool seemed to hide a lot of that behind the scenes.

### Dependencies

- Install and run on personal computer
- need node installed

### Installing

- after cloning, install with `npm install`

### Running the program

- run with `npm run dev`
- or start the server: `npm run server` and then client: `npm run client`

- or build the app first: `npm run build`, start server `npm start` and then then navigate to index.html from /dist
